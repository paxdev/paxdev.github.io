We all know the value of writing automated tests, but standard Unit Testing Frameworks can have a very abstract syntax and make it difficult to understand what tests to write, or to read existing tests, and they certainly do not provide a simple means of communicating in a ubiquitous language between business users and the development team, or even between testers and developers.

Behavioural Driven Development (**BDD**) aims to provide a ubiquitous language for writing tests, or **specifications**, of the system, such that the specifications are written in advance of development of a feature, and the feature is only considered complete when all the specifications pass.

Typically, BDD tests use a **Given**, **When**, **Then** syntax, e.g.

**Scenario**

Finding Product Names

* **Given** a valid Product ID
* **When** I search for the Product Name
* **Then** It should display the expected Product Name

**Machine.Specifications**, or **MSpec**, is a Library that extends this style of testing to individual classes.  
Its aim is to provide a human readable way to describe the behaviour of individual components of the system and to enable the developer to reason about those components in a natural language.

| ProductController, When the product id is valid (2 tests) |Success |
| ---- | ---- |
|  should return ok | Success |
|  should return product name | Success |
